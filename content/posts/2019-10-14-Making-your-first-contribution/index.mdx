# The right time is now 

I clearly remember that during the Q&A session of the last day covering Javascrip at Lamdda School, I asked only one question to 
my instructor, the one and only one awsome @Gab:

> When do you thing we would be ready to contribute to an open source project?

And guess what was his answer? One word:

> Now

Like many (all?) of us starting to learn to code, you start your learning journey with a `bagage` that can stick around 
for(ever?) a long time. And that bagage is called `imposter syndrom`. It can be more or less heavy depending on your 
background and where you are in your journey, but it is definitly something that you want to get rid of, as soon as possible.

So, even if his answer kept me septical at the time, I now know that his answer was what any great teacher would have givin us.

Now is the time, because this imposter syndrom can persist over time  and keep preventing to do do what you are actually capable to do : 
Solving problems, enhancing stuff, Asking questions and helps  ... !

# If when is now, then where do i start?

OK, I hear you, that's great but where/how do I start? I dont think there is only one way of getting started, but to me
the base line is just to stop overthinking it. There are several possible paths that you can explore and/or combine to get
started. But here I am going to share the process that lead me to my first contribution to an external project.

### Start building

You dont need to go for the biggest open source project. Just start a side project on your own, make stretch from your existing ones (push the limits of your todo_list app?), try to build something want to
use yourself, ... anything that keep pushing you to level up your coding skills really.

By doing/staring something, you will most probably struggle, if not, then you are not pushing your game enough. Struggles are good,
because this is where you make real progress. 

Often time, when you struggle on something, you end up searching on Google. You must know it by now, there are no
struggles that you are facing, that no one else have faced (and fixed) before you. So Google is the most powerful tool 
that you have to over come your struggles. This search can lead you to two outcomes:

1. You found something on stackoverflow, in an article, blog .. and you just inject/adapt the solution shared to your code (as long as you understand the solution, it is still progress)
2. You found a (npm) package that provide the outcome you are looking for (I will write an article on my view about npm packages as you start learning later)  

If you end-up with the first path, keep going until the next struggle (I should come soon enough :)

If you end-up using an external package, this is where it could get interresting.  

### Spot possible enhancement or bugs




# Flyaway

Have you ever been in this situation where you feel the need to go for a short break, 
you have saved a little budget to travel ... But then where to go? 
In most cases you will end-up bouncing from one travel websites, search engines to another, then filter down to your budget 
and dates constraints. 
It could be so tiring to the point that you give-up on your break well deserved break :(. 
Well, this is where [flyaway.app](http://flyaway.app) flights Inspiration search can come really handy :). 
From a single search, we provide travel inspirations with a list of flight possible destinations.

Where can I fly to from Paris in the next months for 200 euros? flyaway.app can tell you all ... Have fun !
