One the first thing I have being told as I started learning to code is : 
> "Make sure you understand and master the concept of closure. It is a recurrent topic for tech job interview"

So I put my head on on it, and quickly found out that it is one of the most confusing concept to learn as a beginner. Then, when  you finally kind of reach the ‚ÄúI get it‚Äù state; You are unable to explain it clearly without confusing other begginers

It's exactly like when as kid, you get on learning how to ride bicycle. 

1. The theory sucks and it does not help much to make your first ride. 
2. The only way to actually make progress, is to practice, and probably crash a few times.
3. Then when you finally get it and rides, you wont be able to explain what's the theory around it ...

So here is my 2 cents article to try to make sense of closure as you begin your coder journey. By the end of this article, you should be able to understand this now famous tweet, and hopefully you will feel more like an insider üôÇ

## Some definition.

We will learn about closure by making it real with a minimalistic app (if I can actually call it an app), but first here are some definition from some well known developper resources website.

### From MDN 
[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
> "A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared."

### From 3WS 
[w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp)
> "JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope. Global variables can be made local (private) with closures."

### From Wikipedia 
[wikipedia.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))
> "In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions"


Right, hmmm, confused yet? I bet you are. So let's just try to ride the bike and see what happen once the wheels start rolling ...

## The phone dial pad

Most resources around closure will make you use a "counter" to practice and understand closure. I decided to find another way of illustrating this concept so I make sure that I fully understand what I am actually trying to make you understand.. so we will make a dialling phone pad instead of the "traditional" counter.

To make this article as light as possible we will not build any UI but rather make use of functions to simulate the pad, and console logs to simulate the screen that display the numbers been dialled.

### First thing first we need a phone pad

Let's juste make a raw function for now. I will assume that you understand the basic concept of js functions here and you probably already wrote some.

```javascript 
// declare the function
function phonePad () {
  console.log('i am a phone pad');
}

// invoke the function
phonePad(); // Output 'i am a phone pad'
```

Next we want to be able to tell the Pad what number is being dialled from the pad, so we will just pass that number (strokedDigit) as an argument to phonePad function.

```javascript
function phonePad (strokedDigit) {
  console.log('You dialled this phone number: ' + strokedDigit);
}

// invoke the function with digit #3 passed as a string
phonePad('3');
```

## Twitter shot
## Few definitions
### Functions
### Variables Scope
### Lexical Scope

## Step 1

# H1

It is recommended to NOT use H1s as it is reserved for the article heading. Any H1 is set as an H2.

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

### JSX

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {ThemeProvider} from "theme-ui";
import theme from "./theme";

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme} >
    {props.children}
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
### Javascript

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
