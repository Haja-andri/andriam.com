One the first thing I have being told as I started learning to code is : 
> "Make sure you understand and master the concept of closure. It is a recurrent topic for tech job interview"

So I put my head on on it, and quickly found out that it is one of the most confusing concept to learn as a beginner. Then, when  you finally kind of reach the “I get it” state; You are unable to explain it clearly without confusing other begginers

It's exactly like when as kid, you get on learning how to ride bicycle. 

1. The theory sucks and it does not help much to make your first ride. 
2. The only way to actually make progress, is to practice, and probably crash a few times.
3. Then when you finally get it and rides, you wont be able to explain what's the theory around it ...

So here is my 2 cents article to try to make sense of closure as you begin your coder journey. By the end of this article, you should be able to understand this now famous tweet, and hopefully you will feel more like an insider 🙂

## Some notorious website definition.
## Confused yet ?
## My shot
## Twitter shot
## Few definitions
### Functions
### Variables Scope
### Lexical Scope

## Step 1

# H1

It is recommended to NOT use H1s as it is reserved for the article heading. Any H1 is set as an H2.

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

### JSX

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {ThemeProvider} from "theme-ui";
import theme from "./theme";

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme} >
    {props.children}
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
### Javascript

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
