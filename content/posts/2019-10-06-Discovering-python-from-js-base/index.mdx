# First feeling 

Learning a new langage always feels both, ecxiting and scary at the same time. You are excited because you are going to learn something new, that's by 
it self is ecxiting regardless of what you are learning. But it can be scary as well because you have to get out of
your confort zone. However, if i compare with my feelings when i decided to learn Javascript, the "ecxitment" part was much more dominent than the scary part.

Below are my notes at the end of the first week getting into Python. I will be using Javascript as point of comparaison where relevant.


## Structuring the code

### Variables

The first thing i noticed, is the absence of varatiable label in Python. There is no need to label your variables
with thing like `const`, `var` or `let` in python. You just write the name and asiign an intial value to it.
Its the type of the intial assigned value that will define how the variable can be used later, mostly mutable or not.

```python
my_variable = "initial value assiged"
```
### Comments

Single line comments in Python start with a `#`. As for multi line comments, it looks like there are several interpretation
possible. So i will stick to the `#` notation here so i dont take the risk of misleading you.

```python
# this is a single line comment
# Equivalent to // in js
```

### Console.log

This is straight forward
```python
print("something") # console.log("something")
```
However, the built buil in `print()` function in Python can accomodate more formating parameters such as

```python
print(f"Received variable {variable}") # console.log("something" + variable)
```

### Operators

It looks like as an overall appraoch, Python was designe to be as close as possible to `english words`. 
Therefore in spme cases, symbols will be replaced by `words`. 
Things like `&&`, `||` and `!=` in js, will be replaced by `and`, `or` and `not` in python.
However the operator `===` in js will just be `==`
Also worth noticing that condotional test like `else if` is shortened to `elif`

```python
# Logical operators in python
if A and B: # if (A && B) 
elif A or B: # else if ( A || B)
elif A not B: # else if ( A != B)
else: # else
```

Pythonâ€™s membership operators test the presence of a given data inside a sequence (strings, lists, ...) 
Following are the two main onces

```python
a = 10
b = 20
list = [1, 4, 5, 10 ]

if ( a in list ):
    print("A is present in the list") # Console.log("A is present in the list")
if ( b not in list ):
    print("B is not present in the list") # Console.log("B is not present in the list")
```


### Stronger types (int, string, float, )

Python seems to be strongly typed and required that your data types are in synch before executing an operation. 
For example, a `string` and an `integer` cannot be concanated unless the integer is explicitly converted to a string.

```python
integer = 4 # const loop = 4
string = "Number of wheels" # const string = "Number of wheels"

phrase = string + str(integer) # const phrase =  string + integer
```


### List (array?)

It looks like `List` in python is the equivalent of `array` in Javascript

```python
# Python list
my_fruits = ["orange", "apple", "pear"] # const my_fruits = ["orange", "apple", "pear"]
```
### Dictionnary (Object?)

As for `Dictionary`, the closest thing in javascript would be an object

```python
# Python dictionary
my_fruits = {
    "name": "apple",
    "color" "red",
    "prce": "10
    } # same in js but with a lable (const, var, let) before the variable name
```

### Tuple (Imutable list)

Tuple are similar to List with the following specificities

- The data intialisation is wrapped inside two parentheses `()` and not square brackets `[]`
- And most importantly, typles are not mutable. It can not be changed once initialised
```python
# Python typle
my_fruits = ("orange", "apple", "pear") 
# Have no equivalent in javascript as 
# all variables in js are by default mutable
```

## Functions

### Column, Semi-column, Indentation

Functions bloc code in Python, are not wrapped inside curly brackets `{}`. Python use mostly a combinaison of column `:`
and indemtation to define the start and the end of a bloc of code.
The key word `function` is also replace by key word `def` in Python. 
Finally, there is no need to finish each line of code with a semi-colun `;` as we would do in Javascript

```python
# Python function
def my_function (a, b): # function my_function (a, b) {
    return a + b # return a + b;
# }
```

### Passing as reference vs Value

Arguments in Python can be passed as a reference or as a value. Basically passing a value is passing a copy of the
original data to the function, and that copy will evetually be mutated. Passing as reference on the other and 
send a reference to the original data (memory location). In this case, if we perform mutations on the received 
variable, its actually the original data that will mutated.

If you are like me, being a `visual` person, below illustration was quite helpfull to understand this.

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/pass-by-ref-vs-value.gif"
    alt="Passing as Reference vs Value"
  />
</div>

However, I could not find a way to differentiate them (the two ways) from a pure syntaxe point of view.
My understanding is that the type of argument (mutable or not) the function receives, will
determine the behaviour (reference or value). Probably more on that further down the line.

### Undefined number of arguments

A cool feature in Python is to be able to write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
I am not sure yet practically how it can be used/usefull, but its good to keep in mind. 

```python
def with_arbitrary_num_of_arg(**keywords):
    for key in keywords:
        print(f"key: {key}, value: {keywords[key]}")

# Should print
# key: a, value: 12
# key: b, value: 30
with_arbitrary_num_of_arg(a=12, b=30)
```

## Class

### Self

The `self` keyword in python classes is the equivalent of `this` in javascript classes  

### Inheritence (is a)

Classes can inherit from a `parent` classe properties and methodes by :
1. Passing the parent as argument of the child class definition
2. Refering to the parent in the child class constructor with the keyword `super`   

```python
# Parent class
class LatLon:
    def __init__(self, lat, lon):
        self.lat = lat
        self.lon = lon

# Child class --> Waupoint (is a) LatLon
class Waypoint(LatLon): # Receiving parent class as argument
    def __init__(lat, lon, name):
        super().__init__(self, lat, lon) # Child class constructor with reference to its parent
        self.name = name # Child class specific property
```

### Composition (has a)

Composition is a technique to define a class that can be composed with other classes properties and methodes.
A way to identify the relationship can be done using `has a` between the them. In below example, a `Car` has a `Motor`.

```python
# Class Motor
class Motor:
    def __init__(self, make, cc):
        self.make = make
        self.cc = cc

# Class Car
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, engine):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.engine = engine

# Instance of a Motor
honda_petrol_motor = Motor("Honda", 1799) 
# Instance of Car that has a Honda motor
car = Car("Honda", "Civic", honda_petrol_motor) 
```

## Conclusion

Python feels fairly accessible when you already have some notions of coding from another langage. 
I like its closeness to `english word` compared to other langages. It makes its syntaxes more readable, 
and building memory muscle faster. Its seems to be a good choice also for lower level process, such
as reading and manipulating files from the system, or accessing operating system info. 
At the time of writing this article, I mostly used Python to practice writing algorithms.
That will be the subject of my next article.
