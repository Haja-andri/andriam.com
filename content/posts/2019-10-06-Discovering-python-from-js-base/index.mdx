# First feeling 

Learning a new langage feels ecxiting and scary at the same time. You are excited because you are going to learn something new, that's by 
it self is very ecxiting regardless of what you are learning. But it can be scary as well because you have to get out of
your confort zone. However, this time, i felt more excited than when i decided to learn to code with javascript. I guess my level 
of confidence went up since the beggining of my coder journey  

Below are my intial notes after a week getting into Python @LambdaSchool. I will be using Javascript as point of comparaison where relevant.


## Structuring the code

### Variables

The first thing i have noticed, is the absence of varatiable label in Python. There is no need to label your variables
with thing like `const`, `var` or `let` that are mandatory in Javascript. You just give a variable name, and assign to it an intial value.
Its the type of the intial value that will define how the variable can be used later, mostly if it is mutable or not.

```python
my_variable = "initial value assiged" # const my_variable = "initial value assiged" ib js
```
### Comments

Single line comment in Python start with the character `#`. As for multi line comments, it looks like there are several possible interpretation. 
So i will stick to the single line comment `#` notation here for now.

```python
# this is a single line comment
# Equivalent to `//` in js
```

### Console.log

This is straight forward
```python
print("something") # console.log("something")
```
`Print()` can also accomodate several formating parameters such as the one below

```python
print(f"Received variable {variable}") # console.log("Received variable" + variable)
```

### Operators

As an overall appraoch, Python seems to be designed to be as close as possible to `english words`. 
Therefore in some cases, symbols will be replaced by `plain english words`. 
Things like `&&`, `||` and `!=` in js, will be replaced by `and`, `or` and `not` in python.

Also worth noticing that conditional test `else if` is shortened to `elif`

```python
# Logical operators in python
if A and B: # if (A && B) {} 
elif A or B: # else if ( A || B) {}
elif A not B: # else if ( A != B) {}
else: # else {}
```

Pythonâ€™s membership operators test the presence of a given data inside a sequence (strings, lists, ...) 
Following are the two main onces

```python
a = 10
b = 20
list = [1, 4, 5, 10 ]

if a in list: # so easy to read and remember :)
    print("A is present in the list") # Console.log("A is present in the list")
if b not in list:
    print("B is not present in the list") # Console.log("B is not present in the list")
```

### Stronger types (int, string, float, )

Python seems to be strongly typed and required that your data types are in synch before executing an operation. 
For example, a `string` and an `integer` cannot be concanated unless the integer is explicitly converted to a string.
Which is not required in Javascript

```python
integer = 4 # const loop = 4
string = "Number of wheels" # const string = "Number of wheels"

# the integer is converted first with str(). in JS const phrase =  string + integer
phrase = string + str(integer) 
```


### List (array?)

`List` in Python are similar to `array` in Javascript.

```python
# Python list
my_fruits = ["orange", "apple", "pear"] # const my_fruits = ["orange", "apple", "pear"]
```
### Dictionnary (Object?)

As for `Dictionary`, the closest thing in javascript seems to be objects

```python
# Python dictionary
my_fruits = {
    "name": "apple",
    "color" "red",
    "prce": "10
    } # same in js but with a lable (const, var, let) before the variable name
```

### Tuple (Imutable list)

`Tuple` are similar to `List` with the following specificities

- The data intialisation is wrapped inside two parentheses `()` and not square brackets `[]`
- `Tuples` are not mutable. It can not be changed once initialised
```python
# Python typle
my_fruits = ("orange", "apple", "pear") 
```

## Functions

### Column, Semi-column, Indentation

Functions bloc code in Python, are not wrapped inside curly brackets `{}`. Python function use a combinaison of column `:`
and indentation after the column to define the start and the end of a bloc of code. Its advised to use 4 spaces.
Tabs can be used as well but the entire script must be consistent.
The key word `function` in js is also replace by key word `def` in Python. 
Finally, there is no need to finish each line of code with a semi-colun `;` as we would do in Javascript

```python
# Python function
def my_function (a, b): # the column define the beggining of the bloc
    return a + b # each line of code inside the function must have the same indentation
# }
```

### Passing as reference vs Value

Arguments in Python can be passed as references or as values. Passing a value is passing a copy of the
original data to the function, and that copy will eventually be mutated by the function. 
Passing as reference on the other hand send a reference to the original data (memory location). 
In this case, if we perform any mutations on the received variable, its the original data that will mutated.

If you are like me, being a `visual` person, below illustration was quite helpfull to understand this.

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/pass-by-ref-vs-value.gif"
    alt="Passing as Reference vs Value"
  />
</div>

Having said that, I could not find a way to differentiate them (the two ways) from a pure syntaxe point of view.
My understanding is that the type of argument (mutable or not) the function receives, will
define the behaviour (by reference or value). Probably more on that further down the line.

### Undefined number of arguments

A cool feature in Python is to be able to write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
I am not sure yet practically how it can be used/usefull, but its good to keep in mind. 

```python
def with_arbitrary_num_of_arg(**keywords):
    for key in keywords:
        print(f"key: {key}, value: {keywords[key]}")

# Should print
# key: a, value: 12
# key: b, value: 30
with_arbitrary_num_of_arg(a=12, b=30)
```

## Class

### Self

The `self` keyword in python classes is the equivalent of `this` in javascript classes  

### Inheritence (is a)

Classes can inherit from a `parent` classe properties and methodes by :
1. Passing the parent as argument of the child class 
2. Refering to the parent in the child class constructor with the keyword `super`   

```python
# Parent class
class LatLon:
    def __init__(self, lat, lon):
        self.lat = lat
        self.lon = lon

# Child class --> Waupoint (is a) LatLon
class Waypoint(LatLon): # Receiving parent class as argument
    def __init__(lat, lon, name):
        # Child class constructor with reference to its parent using `super` keyword
        super().__init__(self, lat, lon) 
        self.name = name # Child class specific property
```

### Composition (has a)

Composition is a technique to define a class that can be composed with other classes properties and methodes.
A way to identify this type of relationship is using `has a` between them. In below example, a `Car` has a `Motor`.

```python
# Class Motor
class Motor:
    def __init__(self, make, cc):
        self.make = make
        self.cc = cc

# Class Car
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, engine):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.engine = engine

# Instance of a Motor
honda_petrol_motor = Motor("Honda", 1799) 
# Instance of Car that has a Honda motor
car = Car("Honda", "Civic", honda_petrol_motor) 
```

## Conclusion

Python feels fairly accessible when you already have some notions of coding from another langage. 
I like its closeness to `english word` compared to Javascript. It makes the code more readable, 
and building memory muscle faster. Its seems to be a good choice also for lower level process, such
as reading and manipulating files from the system, or accessing operating system info. 
At the time of writing this article, I mostly used Python to practice writing algorithms.
That will be the subject of my next article.
