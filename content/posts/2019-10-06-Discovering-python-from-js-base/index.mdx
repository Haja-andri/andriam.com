# First feeling 

Learning a new langage always feels both, ecxiting and scary at the same time. You are excited because you are going to learn something new, that's by 
it self is ecxiting regardless of what you are learning. But it can be scary as well because you have to get out of
your confort zone. However, if i compare with my feelings when i decided to learn Javascript, the "ecxitment" part was much more dominent than the scary part.

Below are my notes at the end of the first week getting into Python. I will be using Javascript as point of comparaison where relevant.


## Structuring the code

### Variables

The first thing i noticed, is the absence of varatiable label in Python. There is no need to label your variables
with thing like `const`, `var` or `let` in python. You just write the name and asiign an intial value to it.
Its the type of the intial assigned value that will define how the variable can be used later, mostly mutable or not.

```python
my_variable = "initial value assiged"
```
### Comments

Single line comments in Python start with a `#`. As for multi line comments, it looks like there are several interpretation
possible. So i will stick to the `#` notation here so i dont take the risk of misleading you.

```python
# this is a single line comment
# Equivalent to // in js
```

### Console.log

This is straight forward
```python
print("something") # console.log("something")
```
However, the built buil in `print()` function in Python can accomodate more formating parameters such as

```python
print(f"Received variable {variable}") # console.log("something" + variable)
```

### English vs Symbol

It looks like as an overall appraoch, Python was designe to be as close as possible to `english words`. 
Therefore in spme cases, symbols will be replaced by `words`. 
Things like `&&`, `||` and `!=` in js, will be replaced by `and`, `or` and `not` in python.
However the operator `===` in js will just be `==`
Also worth noticing that condotional test like `else if` is shortened to `elif`

```python
# Logical operators in python
if A and B: # if (A && B) 
elif A or B: # else if ( A || B)
elif A not B: # else if ( A != B)
else: # else
```

Pythonâ€™s membership operators test the presence of a given data inside a sequence (strings, lists, ...) 
Following are the two main onces

```python
a = 10
b = 20
list = [1, 4, 5, 10 ]

if ( a in list ):
    print("A is present in the list") # Console.log("A is present in the list")
if ( b not in list ):
    print("B is not present in the list") # Console.log("B is not present in the list")
```


### Stronger types (int, string, float, )

Python seems to be strongly typed and required that your data types are in synch before executing an operation. 
For example, a `string` and an `integer` cannot be concanated unless the integer is explicitly converted to a string.

```python
integer = 4 # const loop = 4
string = "Number of wheels" # const string = "Number of wheels"

phrase = string + str(integer) # const phrase =  string + integer
```


### List (array?)

It looks like `List` in python is the equivalent of `array` in Javascript

```python
# Python list
my_fruits = ["orange", "apple", "pear"] # const my_fruits = ["orange", "apple", "pear"]
```

### Dictionnary (Object?)

As for `Dictionary`, the closest thing in javascript would be an object

```python
# Python dictionary
my_fruits = {
    "name": "apple",
    "color" "red",
    "prce": "10
    } # same in js but with a lable (const, var, let) before the variable name
```

### Tuple (Imutable list)

Tuple are similar to List with the following specificities

- The data intialisation is wrapped inside two parentheses `()` and not square brackets `[]`
- And most importantly, typles are not mutable. It can not be changed once initialised
```python
# Python typle
my_fruits = ("orange", "apple", "pear") 
# Have no equivalent in javascript as 
# all variables in js are by default mutable
```

## Functions

### Column, Semi-column and Indentation

Functions bloc code in Python, are not wrapped inside curly brackets `{}`. Python use mostly a combinaison of column `:`
and indemtation to define the start and the end of a bloc of code.
The key word `function` is also replace by key word `def` in Python. 
Finally, there is no need to finish each line of code with a semi-colun `;` as we would do in Javascript

```python
# Python function
def my_function (a, b): # function my_function (a, b) {
    return a + b # return a + b;
# }
```

To be continued

### Passing as reference vs Value

### Undefined number of arguments

## Class

### Self

### Inheritence (is a)

### Composition (has a)
