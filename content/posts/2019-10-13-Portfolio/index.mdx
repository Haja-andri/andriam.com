# Passion for Building 

I have a real passion for building things. Sometime, i wish we could have more than 24 hours in a day, 
or that I could sleep less than 5 hours per night, so that I could have enough spare time to build the things I have on my todo list. 
Unfortnatetly, none of them are true nor possible. So this is what I have built on my spare time. 
All these projects have in common the following :

1. I always put specific attention/effort in my work estetics, even if i am not a designer
myself. The bar is ever increasing to give users the best experience possiblewhen they visit your site. 
And i believe that estetics play a great role for that.    

2. Every single project that I start (when i have time) must be driven by a real need. Oftenly, something 
that i would want and/or use myself.

# Clezer

Ideas often come from personal experiences, good or bad onesâ€¦ in Clezer case it was another get together weekend
with some of my best friends. The full story can be read [here](https://medium.com/clezer/the-light-bulb-week-end-how-clezer-became-an-evidence-1be8cca4963f).

[Clezer](http://clezer.com) was specialised in innovative payment. We introduced the first shared debit card for groups, able to debit multiple accounts in real time.
And a chat bot to help groups to split any payments in real time.

# Flyaway

Have you ever been in this situation where you feel the need to go for a short break, 
you have saved a little budget to travel ... But then where to go? 
In most cases you will end-up bouncing from one travel websites, search engines to another, then filter down to your budget 
and dates constraints. 

It could be so tiring to the point that you give-up on your well deserved break :(. 
Well, this is where [flyaway.app](http://flyaway.app) flights Inspiration search can come really handy :). 
From a single search, we provide travel inspirations with a list of flight possible destinations.

Where can I fly to from Paris in the next months for 200 euros? flyaway.app can tell you all ... Have fun !

# Codelify

Code Snippets are everywhere in the developer info stream, on twitter, stack overflow, tutorials, medium/blog articles ... However, there is no way to easily and efficiently store, organise, index and search/find them for futur use. At best you have a (very long) static file on GitHub, or worst, a google doc :(.

[Codelify](http://bit.ly/codelify) is the tool to go to to resolve this challenge. It was born during Lambda School 2019/20 winter Hackathon

### Key Features

Codelify is deployed at [Codelify](http://bit.ly/codelify).

It allows developers to have a centralised place to easily:

- Create and Store Snippets
- Organise, Upadate, Delete them
- Index (Title, Description, Tags)
- Search and filter through them.

Code Snippets you they to keep. Snippets that they find from the world wide web, as well as snippets that you created alike. Then, when the time comes, and it will come :) you can easily find and (re)use them
