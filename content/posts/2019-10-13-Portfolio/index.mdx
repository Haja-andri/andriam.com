# Just Passion 

I have a real passion for building things that matters. Sometime, actually often, i wish we could have more than 24 hours in a day.
Or I could sleep less than 5 hours per night, so that I could have enough spare time to build the things I have on my todo list. Unfortnatetly, none of them are true nor possible. 
So this is what I have built on my spare time. 
What all these projects have in common is that :

1. I always put specific attention/effort in my work estetics. even if i am not a designer
myself. The bar is ever increasing to make users feel home when they browse your site. And i believe that estetics
play a great role for that.    

2. Every single project that I carry on (when i have time) must be driven by a real mission. Oftenly, something 
that i would want and/or use myself.

# Clezer

Ideas often come from personal experiences, good or bad onesâ€¦ in Clezer case it was another get together weekend
with some of my best friends. The full story can be read [here](https://medium.com/clezer/the-light-bulb-week-end-how-clezer-became-an-evidence-1be8cca4963f).

[Clezer](http://clezer.com) was specialised in innovative payment. We introduced the first shared debit card for groups, able to debit multiple accounts in real time.
And a chat bot to help groups to split any payments in real time.
