# Passion for Building 

I have a real passion for building things. Sometime, I wish we could have more than 24 hours in a day, 
or that I could sleep less than 5 hours per night. Unfortnatetly, none of them are true nor possible. 
So this is what I have built on my spare time. All these projects have in common the following :

1. I not a designer but I always put specific attention/effort in my work estetics. 
The bar is ever increasing to give users the best experience possible when they visit your site. And i believe that estetics play a great role (out of many others) for that.

2. Every single side project that I start (when i have time) must be driven by a real need. Oftenly, something 
that i would want and/or use myself.

3. I like working with a team, it creates accountability and optimize opportunities for learning. For most of my projects, I convinced a small and lean team to join me along.


# Clezer

Ideas often come from personal experiences, good or bad onesâ€¦ in Clezer case it was another get together weekend
with some of my best friends. The full story can be read [here](https://medium.com/clezer/the-light-bulb-week-end-how-clezer-became-an-evidence-1be8cca4963f).

[Clezer](http://clezer.com) was specialised in innovative payment. We introduced the first shared debit card for groups, able to debit multiple accounts in real time.
And a chat bot to help groups to split any payments in real time.

# Flyaway

Have you ever been in this situation where you feel the need to go for a short break, 
you have saved a little budget to travel ... But then where to go? 
In most cases you will end-up bouncing from one travel websites, search engines to another, then filter down to your budget 
and dates constraints. 

It could be so tiring to the point that you give-up on your well deserved break ðŸ˜Ÿ. 
Well, this is where [flyaway.app](http://flyaway.app) flights Inspiration search can come really handy ðŸ˜€. 
It provides a list of possible destinations from your chosen origin, with a single search.

# Codelify

Code Snippets are everywhere in the developer info stream, on twitter, stack overflow, tutorials, medium/blog articles ... However, there is no way to easily and efficiently store, organise, index and search them for futur use.
[Codelify](http://bit.ly/codelify) is the tool to go to, to resolve this challenge.

Dotpay provide a simple yet efficient solution for them to easily collect payment online through sharable unique link.

# Station

Most, real estate agency and coworking space business, are still managing their leasing contract and related payments, like in the late nineties ðŸ˜…. They process paper based contract signature (print => sign => scan => email). Then, rollout paper based bank debit autorisation for rent collection, forced to deal with there banks ugly, non UX-driven interface on monthly basis.

Station bring them back to the future with electronic contract management and signature, blended with automated invoicing and payment collections. Just like simple online subscription.
