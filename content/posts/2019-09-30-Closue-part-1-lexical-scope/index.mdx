As I started learning to code, one of the first thing I have being told  is the following: 
> "Make sure you understand and master closures. It is a recurrent topic for tech related job interview"

I was not sure why, but I put my head down and started reading about closures. I then quickly realised that it is one of the most 
confusing concept to learn as a beginner. And the only way for it to make sense at all, is to actually write code and play around.

It's exactly like learning to ride a bike as kid. 

1. The theory sucks and it does not help you much to get your bike rolling. 
2. The only way to learn, is to get on the bike, and probably crash a few times.
3. Then when you finally get your bike rolling, you will most probably not be able to explain it back, clearly and concisely.

So here is my 2 cents tentative to try to help you make sense of closure as you begin your coder journey. 
By the end of this serie of articles, you should be able to understand the below, now famous tweet, and feel more like an insider ðŸ™‚

## Some "offical" definition.

First here are some definition from some of the well known developper resources website.

### MDN 

> A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

### 3WS 

> JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope. Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

### Wikipedia 

> In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions.


Right, hmmm, confused yet? I bet you are. So let's just try to ride the bike along and see what happen once the wheels start rolling ...

## The phone dial pad

Most tutorials about closure will make you build a "counter" to practice and understand closure. 
I wanted to find another way of illustrating this concept to make sure that I actually understand what I am trying to make you understand ... 
So we will build a phone dial pad instead of the "traditional" counter.

Disclaimer: To make this article as light as possible we will not build any UI but rather make use of raw functions to simulate the interactions with the pad, and console logs to simulate the screen display.

### Step #1, the phone pad

The phone pad will take the form of a raw function as below.

```javascript 
// Function declaration
function phonePad () {
  console.log('I am a phone pad');
}
// invoke the function
phonePad(); // Output 'I am a phone pad'
```

Pretty simple right? Next, we want to be able to tell the Pad which digit has been selected from the pad to make up the phone number. 
For that, we will just pass the each digit as an argument to phonePad function.

```javascript
function phonePad (digit) {
  console.log('You pressed digit: ' + digit);
}
// invoke the function with digit #3 passed as a string
phonePad('3'); // Console output 'You pressed digit:  3'
```
So far so good ! but this does not constitute a phone number, we want to dial the entire 10 digits like "0617570159" right? 
So lets keep invoking our phonePad function passing in the series of digits that constitute the phone number we intend to call.

```javascript
function phonePad (digit) {
  console.log('You stroke digit: ' + digit);
}
// invoke phonePad function for each stroke 
phonePad('0'); // Console output 'You stroke digit:  0'
phonePad('6'); // Console output 'You stroke digit:  6'
phonePad('5'); // Console output 'You stroke digit:  5'
phonePad('7'); // Console output 'You stroke digit:  7'
```

Of course, you realised quickly that our phonePad function 
do not actually remember any of the previous digit selected, and therefore our concole is just printing the last digit received.
We need some memory !

### Step #2 give the pad some memory

So lets try to give the pad some memory with variable to store each new digit received. 
With ES6 syntax we would declare a "let" variable and give it the received number inside phonePad().

```javascript
// intialise the number to an empty string
let dialledNumber = '';

function phonePad (digit) {
  console.log('You stroke digit: ' + digit);
  // concatanate each new stroke to build the dialled number
  dialledNumber = dialledNumber.concat(digit);
  console.log('The phone number to call is: ' + digit);
}

phonePad('0'); 
phonePad('6');
phonePad('5');
```
The console should display something like this
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/console.png"
    alt="Console output 2"
  />
</div>

It looks like we are getting closer to what we are looking for. The console output display the number and each new input 
is concatanated with the previous one. 
However this code has a major flaw as we will see later. But first lets take note of a verify important concept
that is part of the building blocs of closure: Lexical scope.

### Step #3 understading lexical scope

As you can see, our phonePad() function is able to read and mutate the variable "dialledNumber", 
even if it was declared outside of its curly brackets {} scope. The variable "dialledNumber" here, kind of behave like a global variable,
and because it is reachable by phonePad(), we can say it is in the lexical scope of phonePad(). 

However, lets create a variable say "internalToPhonePad", that we declared inside the phonePad() function brackets {} bloc. 
This variable will not be reachable outside of the function curly brackets {} bloc. Should we try to read or mutate it 
from the outside, then our code would break. We can say that "internalToPhonePad" is not in the lexical scope of its surrounding environment 

```javascript
function phonePad (digit) {
  // declaring a variable inside phonePad()
  const internalToPhonePad = "inside phonePad()"
}
// trying to access internaVariable from the outside breaks the code
console.log(internalToPhonePad);
```

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/error-3.png"
    alt="Console output error"
  />
</div>

Yes, Lexical scope can expend only one way : inside --> out. When a function need to process a variable, it will look first inside
its curly brackets {} bolc. If it cannot find it, then it will scan outside of that bloc. 
In short, phonePad() can see outside of its {} bracket scope, but the outside cannot see what happens inside phonePad().

In the next article we will talk about nested function and referencing
